A transmission-related data loss occured during acquisition of ASOS high resolution 
(one and five minute) data resulting in the loss of approximately 4550 station files 
(around 4 million observations). It appears, at this point, that this data will not be 
recovered. The period affected is March 31, 2010 through May 3, 2010. In the event that 
any of this data is recovered in the future, it will be posted here.
