1.   Abstract: A major part of the NWS modernization effort in the 1990's is the implementation of the Automated Surface Observations System (ASOS).  Data are collected and transmitted automatically.  Several sites will not be manned.  As new sensors are developed to observe additional weather elements (currently not measurable by automatic sensors) they will be implemented.  Some of the elements not currently measured include tornados, thunderstorms, hail, drizzle, blowing obstructions to vision, sunshine, snowfall, snow depth and clouds above 12,000 feet.  

Five-minute data will be stored on station for a limited time (12 hours).  NCDC routinely downloads these data, at least for a selected set of stations. Discussions are underway with NWS to receive these data routinely for as many stations as possible.

Station Data Time Averaging - The Automated Surface Observations System is designed to collect data continuously.  Five-minute reports are computed from data accumulations over the following time periods prior to the report:

Cloud Height                             30 minutes
Visibility                               10 minutes
Present Weather                          10 minutes
Freezing Rain                            15 minutes
Temperature/Dew Point                     5 minutes
Wind                                      2 minutes
Pressure                                  1 minute
Precipitation Accumulation                1 hour

Network Participation - The network consists of NWS and FAA ASOS sites which are expected to number approximately 1200 when fully commissioned in the late 1990's.  Negotiations are continuing concerning transmission and archival of five-minute data from these stations.  The number of stations that will ultimately participate in providing five-minute data has not been determined.

Elevation Distribution - Elevations are generally below 1000 meters above sea level.  The minimum elevation is near sea level and the maximum elevation is about 2000 meters.

Instrument Problems - Investigations are currently underway to determine the differences between conventional and automated observations.  Specific instrumental and data problems are addressed in articles published in various journals of the American Meteorological Society.  Additional information might be obtained from the ASOS Program Office, NWS Headquarters, Silver Spring, MD.

Missing Data Periods - There are no general periods of missing data for this relatively new data set.  Data may be missing at random times due to instrument failures or communications problems in downloading data from specific sites.
                                              
Error Detection and Correction - See ASOS USER'S GUIDE. Several automated error checks are accomplished at the observation site.  When downloaded to NCDC, the data are processed through computer software to reformat the data.  No attempt is made to correct the data.  

Missing Value Estimates - Replacement values for missing data are not estimated.

This is a new data set. The data are expected to support the same types of uses for previous surface data products, including quality control of lower resolution data, climatological research, litigation, insurance investigations, and hydrological research and engineering designs.

The record has fixed-length fields.  The last field contains remarks and may range from 1 to 133 characters.  The remarks field is blank filled as necessary to achieve a fixed length of 133 characters.

2.   Element Names and Definitions: Data are archived in a variable-length file structure. The first five fields in the record are fixed for a length of 28 characters.  The remainder of each record contains the five minute data and remarks generated at the station and may be 1 to 472 characters in length.  Archived data are currently sorted by Station ID (WBAN number) as the primary key and year, month, day, hour and minute as secondary keys.

Each variable-length logical record contains one station's 5-minute data values for all reported meteorological elements.  The record consists of a control word, an identification portion and a data portion.  The control word is used by the computer operating system for record length determination.  The identification portion, added at archive time, includes the station number, Icao call sign, station call sign, and observation date and time (LST).  The data portion contains the complete unedited record as received from the observation site. Each element is classified as numeric [N] or alphanumeric [A] as indicated after each element name.  Values recorded in numeric elements are right justified with unused positions zero-filled; signed numbers always begin with a "+" or a "-" in the left-most position.  Recorded values in alphanumeric elements are left-justified and unused positions are filled with blanks.

Missing and unknown values of numeric elements are generally indicated by all nines; sometimes recorded as a signed number.  In instances when all nines in a numeric element could represent a value within the range of values for the element, another numeric constant (outside the range of values) will be used to indicate missing/unknown.  Missing and unknown values of alpha-
numeric elements are recorded as all blanks.

VISIBILITY [N]
Visibility measured in miles.  Reportable values are <1/4, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 11/4, 11/2, 13/4, 2, 21/2, 3, 31/2, 4, 5, 7 and 10 or 10+.  The symbols valid for this element are:  <, /, + and digits 0-9 inclusive.

WEATHER AND OBSTRUCTIONS [A]
The Weather and Obstruction field is a twenty character field that specifies the weather and/or obstruction occurring at the time of the observation.  The ASOS system at this writing reports precipitation (P-, R-, R, R+, ZR-, ZR, S-, S, S+) and obstructions (H or F).  Only one obstruction is reported in a single observation.  Other weather types may be edited into the record by the observer.  For a complete list of weather and obstruction types, see the documentation for the hourly data (TD3280), Environmental Information Summary C-2 (EIS C-2), NWS Observing Handbook No. 7, or the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 (FMH-1). 

SKY CONDITION [A]
The Sky Condition field is a twenty-five character field that specifies the height and amount of up to three cloud layers as determined by the ASOS ceilometer.  The layers occur up to 12,000 ft.  A ceiling designation "M" is prefixed to the lowest broken or overcast layer, "W" for indefinite ceiling, "X" for obscuration, and "V" for variable ceiling.  The observer may edit an "E" into the record when the automated sensor is inoperative and the ceiling height is estimated.

Heights are given in hundredths of feet above the ground, e.g. 15 is 1500 ft. If no layers are detected below 12,000 ft. the message, "CLR BLO 120" is entered.  The layer amounts are SCT, BKN and OVC.  Valid contractions for this element are:  CLR, BLO, SCT, BKN and OVC.

(The altimeter scale has a range of 28.00 to 31.00 inches.  The altimeter setting is determined by subtracting the station elevation from the pressure altitude and converting the remainder to inches of mercury.  The altimeter setting will then fall within the range of the altimeter scale.)  The altimeter setting is recorded in hundredths of an inch of mercury using the units, tenths, and hundredths digits, e.g. 015 means an altimeter setting of 30.15 inches.  Missing/unknown values are recorded as 444.

RELATIVE HUMIDITY [N]
The ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the actual vapor pressure of the air to the saturation vapor pressure.  (The amount of water vapor in the air expressed as a percentage of the amount of water vapor the air could hold at that same temperature and pressure).  Range of values:  001-100 inclusive.  Missing/unknown values are recorded as 999.

The pressure altitude corrected for temperature variations from the standard atmosphere.  Density altitude is reported in whole feet.  Missing/unknown values are recorded as -9999.

WIND DIRECTION - MAGNETIC [N]
The direction of the wind related to magnetic north.  Wind direction is recorded in tens of degrees from magnetic north.  Values range from 000 to 360, where 000 indicates calm and 360 indicates magnetic north.  Missing/unknown values are recorded as 999.

WIND SPEED - MAGNETIC [N]
Wind speed is reported in whole knots.  All zeros in the field indicate calm conditions.  Wind speed - magnetic is the same as wind speed associated with true north.  Missing/unknown values are recorded as 999.
